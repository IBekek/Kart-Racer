# KartRacer

This is a time attack racer made for a university project, and was the first 'finished' game I've made. Though the focus was mainly on creating racing game mechanics, I've also taken in upon myself to create beautiful rural environment and try my hand im map design. Main features include:

  * Medals and best times system

  * Checkpoint and respawn system

  * Score system

  * Stylized, cartoon-y look and rural themed map

Most 3D model assets were downloaded from store, though I've still made some of my own (Like the animated cows and the barn). I learned a lot about 3D modelling and working with materials, as well as other systems used in this type of games (and others too for that matter).
The only major problem I've encountered was not being able to implement a working gokart model I've made, and after many attempts I could not get it to work properly. 
The game was a huge success though, earing maximum points and the highest grade!

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
